# How to use ?





## topic_extractor.py
Used to scrap locally.
Specify in the beginning the options you want to use.



## DockerReadyApp
Folder to download, ready to build a working image.
The image can be run in Docker, or pushed to ECR and used in AWS.



## ðŸš§ building alternative scraper ðŸš§
Optional work.
Working on converting the topic_extractor.py from Selenium to BS4.
Selenium is very slow, in addition to be more difficult for building a working image.
